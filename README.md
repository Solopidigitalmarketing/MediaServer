# MediaServer 

This is a C# project targeting the .NET 9 framework. It uses sockets to create a server and serves files to clients. It derives from a [DLNA project](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1079847/DLNA-Media-Server-to-feed-Smart-TVs) by Dr Gadgit. 

## Purpose

This fork does 2 main things:

- Refactors the original to use modern .NET framework and methodologies
- Establishes a base to learn multimedia networking, socket programming, and http methodology
